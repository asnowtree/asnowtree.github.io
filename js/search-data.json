The following is a thing I wanted to do but failed to do well in college. It may not be what you are interested in, but the analyzed problems can be used as a reference for most people, and this snow tree will provide some functional services To solve such problems allows you to better express yourself, so that you can execute your interests more smoothly. My major in university is related to semiconductors and belongs to the field of electronic technology, so I later realized quadcopter (unmanned aerial vehicle). At that time, I wanted to make one myself (there were already many open source technologies at that time), and this is indeed a pure interest that can support me to work hard. In addition to interest in quadcopters, there is also a lot of improvement in professional knowledge related to semiconductors, chips, computers, algorithms, communications, and physics and mathematics. Due to various reasons, I finally failed to make a homemade quadcopter, although I read a lot of documents. It’s a lot of fun (and touches on physics, computers, math, materials chemistry, etc.). As mentioned above, I did not complete the self-made quadcopter in the end. The reasons include but are not limited to the following points: . 1. Knowledge reserve skill issue 2. Resource issue 3 Energy issue 4 Communication issue &amp; team issue Knowledge reserve skills problem, . Semiconductors, chips, computers: The control center of the quadcopter completes the flight, control, take-off and landing, and controls the flight speed. The core hardware flight control chip is required. It completes the program execution and instruction execution written by the programmer, and a large number of calculations , to receive the radio wave signal sent by the remote control. It also involves physics, mechanics, mathematics, Euler angles to complete the calculation and control of flight and flight body attitude, PCB packaging issues, and motor algorithms to complete the control of motor rotation speed and current. Although there are documents, it also took me a lot of time to consult and absorb and understand. Resource Issues , . Required on hardware: brain - flight control chip limbs - brushless motor propeller heart - lithium battery skeleton - remote control of aircraft shelf Required on software: software for writing programs tool. These are great resources. Energy problems . As mentioned above, there is a lot of knowledge reserves, it is difficult for one person to learn multiple professional knowledge, it may be more reasonable to have one major in physics, one major in computer science and one major in mathematics . Communication Issues &amp; Team Issues . In fact, it is difficult to complete the quadcopter after solving the problems 1 and 2 above. The energy problem needs to be solved by the team. The energy problem has been solved, but the communication needs to be pulled out separately, because a multi-person team needs to execute things in an orderly manner, with a clear process and a clear division of labor, which requires communication management. The above example just means that complex things cannot be bypassed in terms of 1. knowledge reserve skill issue 2. resource issue 3 energy issue 4 communication issue &amp; team issue, And people with the same interest can solve these problems through effective communication and coordination. The Xueshu platform provides auxiliary services in terms of “communication” and “coordination”, so that “communication” and “coordination” go smoothly. ",

    "title": "living environment",
    "content": "There is a difference between humans and monkeys in the mountains. It is obvious that humans have left behind human geography, talked about civilization, and talked about progress. I hope it is not understood as discrimination against monkeys. It refers to the obvious difference that humans can feel compared with monkeys, and it leads to the topic that the environment has a great impact on people. Maybe they have their own civilization . The predecessors plant trees and the descendants enjoy the shade. The living environment is like calculus. Newton said \"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\". I like this sentence very much. He understands that he has learned a lot from his predecessors, and with the help of his teachers and friends, he has successfully achieved success in various fields. , of course he also gives back to society (eg his research paper). Appearance: Some people were hit by a car while running a red light, some people couldn’t afford to go to school, some people were smashed by a huge concrete bridge while driving (the car was directly smashed), and recently I heard that some people went swimming in Sanya and drowned. People are also full of happiness, and it is wonderful that people are different. Listing the bad ones here is just to say that hopefully some things can improve progress. After airplanes were built in the early 20th century, not all people in the world knew how to fly airplanes. It was the people who built airplanes who first learned how to arrange them and then taught the first wave of people to drive them. After the first wave of people learned it, they gradually became familiar with it. Only the experience of a master can teach others to fly a plane; many things are done step by step, and the more complicated things are, the more so. Running a red light is not an individual, it is universal, it is not an individual issue, it is a matter of time. (It took others many years to make an airplane. If you have to make it in a month and test it, it will only blow up.) This is an analogy, which means that many areas of life need to be step by step, otherwise it may explode Machine. I think that running a red light is a traffic explosion machine, being smashed by cement is a construction explosion machine, and not being able to afford school in a deep mountain is not a explosion machine. It is a natural phenomenon. Life is very different, and productivity is not the same. draw a picture . You can draw a picture with your friends, you can discuss what you want to draw, what if you have different ideas and both stick to your own ideas? Use the canvas alone to paint what you want to paint, and don’t affect your friend’s mood of painting. In this way, I think you should all be in a good mood, and you can all paint what you want to paint. Even after painting two paintings, you can compare and discuss them, without embarrassment at all. step by step . Some of the problems in the living environment mentioned above are just real problems (some problems exist in the world, not just in China), but I don’t want to describe too much; it just means that Xueshu platform hopes to provide its own services, and it is in the strict professional field. Step-by-step process helps, so that there are fewer problems, and things are done better and with higher quality. There are fewer traffic accidents by running red lights, and the quality of education is better. Xueshu platform does not directly do these things; Xueshu uses services such as communication, learning and communication to improve users and be better themselves (reasons), and then they are in the field of transportation and education. With better performance (results). This is very abstract (when other environment variables remain unchanged), but it is certain, if the user wants to do better. For example, user A is a member of the traffic bureau, or a driver, or a person who runs a red light, any of the three parties, The platform hopes to be an external factor that can improve users themselves, so that A can do better, Any one of the three factors (traffic management, driver, and hit party) involved in the accident of running a red light can do better, In this way, when a red light accident occurs, it can be handled better (traffic rules, emergency braking when driving, and pedestrian safety awareness). The platform is mainly engaged in communication and assistance services based on information protocols and interests. The background mentioned above actually involves many aspects. It just shows that many things can be done by others, and many things can be optimized and done better. ",

As mentioned above, I did not complete the self-made quadcopter in the end. The reasons include but are not limited to the following points: . 1. Knowledge reserve skill issue 2. Resource issue 3 Energy issue 4 Communication issue &amp; team issue Knowledge reserve skills problem, . Semiconductors, chips, computers: The control center of the quadcopter completes the flight, control, take-off and landing, and controls the flight speed. The core hardware flight control chip is required. It completes the program execution and instruction execution written by the programmer, and a large number of calculations , to receive the radio wave signal sent by the remote control. It also involves physics, mechanics, mathematics, Euler angles to complete the calculation and control of flight and flight body attitude, PCB packaging issues, and motor algorithms to complete the control of motor rotation speed and current. Although there are documents, it also took me a lot of time to consult and absorb and understand. Resource Issues , . Required on hardware: brain - flight control chip limbs - brushless motor propeller heart - lithium battery skeleton - remote control of aircraft shelf Required on software: software for writing programs tool. These are great resources. Energy problems . As mentioned above, there is a lot of knowledge reserves, it is difficult for one person to learn multiple professional knowledge, it may be more reasonable to have one major in physics, one major in computer science and one major in mathematics . Communication Issues &amp; Team Issues . In fact, it is difficult to complete the quadcopter after solving the problems 1 and 2 above. The energy problem needs to be solved by the team. The energy problem has been solved, but the communication needs to be pulled out separately, because a multi-person team needs to execute things in an orderly manner, with a clear process and a clear division of labor, which requires communication management. The above example just means that complex things cannot be bypassed in terms of 1. knowledge reserve skill issue 2. resource issue 3 energy issue 4 communication issue &amp; team issue, And people with the same interest can solve these problems through effective communication and coordination. The Xueshu platform provides auxiliary services in terms of “communication” and “coordination”, so that “communication” and “coordination” go smoothly. ",

He understands that he has learned a lot from his predecessors, and with the help of his teachers and friends, he has successfully achieved success in various fields. , of course he also gives back to society (eg his research paper). Appearance: Some people were hit by a car while running a red light, some people couldn’t afford to go to school, some people were smashed by a huge concrete bridge while driving (the car was directly smashed), and recently I heard that some people went swimming in Sanya and drowned. People are also full of happiness, and it is wonderful that people are different. Listing the bad ones here is just to say that hopefully some things can improve progress. After airplanes were built in the early 20th century, not all people in the world knew how to fly airplanes. It was the people who built airplanes who first learned how to arrange them and then taught the first wave of people to drive them. After the first wave of people learned it, they gradually became familiar with it. Only the experience of a master can teach others to fly a plane; many things are done step by step, and the more complicated things are, the more so. Running a red light is not an individual, it is universal, it is not an individual issue, it is a matter of time. (It took others many years to make an airplane. If you have to make it in a month and test it, it will only blow up.) This is an analogy, which means that many areas of life need to be step by step, otherwise it may explode Machine. I think that running a red light is a traffic explosion machine, being smashed by cement is a construction explosion machine, and not being able to afford school in a deep mountain is not a explosion machine.

You can draw a picture with your friends, you can discuss what you want to draw, what if you have different ideas and both stick to your own ideas? Use the canvas alone to paint what you want to paint, and don’t affect your friend’s mood of painting.

Even after painting two paintings, you can compare and discuss them, without embarrassment at all. step by step .

Step-by-step process helps, so that there are fewer problems, and things are done better and with higher quality. There are fewer traffic accidents by running red lights, and the quality of education is better. Xueshu platform does not directly do these things; Xueshu uses services such as communication, learning and communication to improve users and be better themselves (reasons), and then they are in the field of transportation and education. With better performance (results). This is very abstract (when other environment variables remain unchanged), but it is certain, if the user wants to do better. For example, user A is a member of the traffic bureau, or a driver, or a person who runs a red light, any of the three parties, The platform hopes to be an external factor that can improve users themselves, so that A can do better, Any one of the three factors (traffic management, driver, and hit party) involved in the accident of running a red light can do better, In this way, when a red light accident occurs, it can be handled better (traffic rules, emergency braking when driving, and pedestrian safety awareness). The platform is mainly engaged in communication and assistance services based on information protocols and interests. The background mentioned above actually involves many aspects. It just shows that many things can be done by others, and many things can be optimized and done better. ",

For example, user A is a member of the traffic bureau, or a driver, or a person who runs a red light, any of the three parties, The platform hopes to be an external factor that can improve users themselves, so that A can do better, Any one of the three factors (traffic management, driver, and hit party) involved in the accident of running a red light can do better, In this way, when a red light accident occurs, it can be handled better (traffic rules, emergency braking when driving, and pedestrian safety awareness). The platform is mainly engaged in communication and assistance services based on information protocols and interests. The background mentioned above actually involves many aspects. It just shows that many things can be done by others, and many things can be optimized and done better. ",
