<h1 id="intention">Intention</h1>
<p>There is always a starting point for doing things, and explanation is very important when multiple people communicate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Who am I? Where am I from? Where am I going? Why should I write an article specifically for the starting point? I always feel that there is no clear and understandable starting point for doing things, and it is difficult to get others to agree and support what you do; even when someone wants to help and support you, they don’t quite understand your starting point and don’t know how to do it effectively help you (as someone close to you).</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="do-something-interesting">Do something interesting</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>The results of some things are important, but doing or not doing is another matter.</p>

  <p>I always feel that many platforms lack flavor, and I don’t know exactly where. The technological gap between the East and the West 100 years ago can be the talk of the moment. Who will remember who 100 years from now? I just hope that there will be no gap in technology and protocols in 100 years. And the mental body and soul are getting better and better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note">I am working on an information exchange, communication and cooperation (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">based on agreement &amp; interest</code>) service platform, <a href="https://asnowtree.cn/article/platform/2022-07-07-asnowtree-platform">asnowtree.cn</a> at the beginning The starting point is to make things easier for those who do things; so that things are easier to complete, here we call it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Xueshu Platform</code>. It involves many fields, and each field can have its leader. Temporarily set up three specialized sections in the construction field, software field, and work field to provide assistance services in information and data release, social communication, and professional learning.</p>

<p>I have found people I know to communicate with. What confuses me is my expression. I feel that many times I cannot express my thoughts accurately in front of others. So much so that they don’t know how to do it even if they want to help me, which I think is important, even though what I’m doing or my thinking might be a little crazy.</p>

<p>First of all, I will find problems in myself, the only thing I can ask and change is myself</p>

<h2 id="make-it-easier-for-people-who-do-things">Make it easier for people who do things</h2>

<p>Achieve assistance (help) effect through several functions</p>

<ul class="note info">
  <li>1 Make relevant information flow faster and more accurate, efficient communication, less errors.</li>
  <li>2 Rich information content, wider knowledge point contact.</li>
  <li>3 sub-fields for people with the same hobbies, more professional learning but also a relaxed atmosphere.</li>
  <li>4 as a reference.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1-let-related-information-flow-faster-and-more-accurately-efficient-communication-fewer-mistakes">1 Let related information flow faster and more accurately, efficient communication, fewer mistakes.</h3>

<p>Relevant information: For example, if the matter itself is to improve math scores, then the relevant information is related to the mathematics major; if the matter itself is job hunting, the relevant information is related to job hunting</p>

<h3 id="2-rich-information-content-wider-knowledge-point-contact">2 Rich information content, wider knowledge point contact.</h3>

<p>The platform provides a field classification function. Different fields can have different documents, knowledge, and communication styles. People who like to learn can quickly find the knowledge content they are interested in through field positioning.</p>

<h3 id="3-sub-fields-to-socialize-people-with-the-same-hobbies-more-professional-learning-but-also-a-relaxed-atmosphere">3 sub-fields to socialize people with the same hobbies, more professional learning but also a relaxed atmosphere.</h3>

<p>The field can be professional, and it should be professional. When you immerse yourself in or tackle a problem in a certain field, you hope that other people and resources in the field can help you.</p>

<h3 id="4-as-a-reference">4 as a reference</h3>

<p class="note info">The platform can have some <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reference solutions</code> for the way of doing things; people may encounter many difficulties and don’t know how to do it. Even as a platform, it is difficult to predict why people who use this platform will worry about it next, but there can be Relatively professional and abstract domain solutions are used as reference. For example, if a person lives in a rural area and his house needs to be renovated or rebuilt for a long time, he does not know how to start. Perhaps the guidance on building a house in the field of construction here can help this rural person avoid detours and save some money. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Energy</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">finance</code>.</p>

<p>This is the end of the expression of the starting point. The following is why there is such a starting point. It looks boring.</p>

<h2 id="background">background</h2>

<p>Here are some food for thought</p>

<p>ideas, work, interests…</p>

<h3 id="thought">Thought</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>People have no thoughts, and they are no worse than wood. They can be a pillar that is needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Would you read this if you hadn’t thought, which leans toward wisdom.</p>

<p>game theory</p>

<h3 id="work">Work</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The environment is constantly changing, and the work will also change accordingly, especially in a rapidly developing society. It’s best to understand why you work. The working environment is also very important. Time and space are constantly changing. Time does not stop for anything, and the environment you are in will also change. At least the oxygen molecules in the air must be different from yesterday, unless you are in a confined space, it is also a pool of stagnant water.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note info">If you are reading this because you are looking for a job, then you have come to the right place, where we plan to start from scratch about job communication guidance information and job information.</p>
<p>Work is a lifelong event. The temporary focus here is long-term thinking and planning communication based on stability and life; of course, it is also important for users to have a way to find a job immediately, but this requires a stable foundation (for example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the number of information release sources </code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Reliability of the information released</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Whether the user who released the information has credit</code>);
If the user feels that it is more important to have a job immediately than stability, and respect the user’s ideas and choices, the platform can receive <a href="https://asnowtree.cn/info-panel#message">message</a> feedback. There is no monopoly here. Users can go to other job platforms to view job recruitment information, and the choice is the user’s own business.</p>

<h3 id="interest">interest</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone can have their own interests and hobbies, but some people may not pay for their love very well due to various reasons. This is closely related to the future of young people themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="note info">There can be a tool that allows you to express your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">interests and ideas</code> through the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">communication service</code>, so that people with similar interests and hobbies can see you! And may have the same interests and hobbies in the follow-up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">working together</code>.</p>

<h3 id="precious-time">precious time</h3>

<p>When you are young and full of passion and energy, what do you want to do? What a precious time, gold can’t buy an inch of time, everyone’s life is more than one thing; the best thing is of course to do the right thing at the right time, and have someone to do it with you.</p>

<h4 id="example">example</h4>

<p class="note info">The following is a thing I wanted to do but failed to do well in college. It may not be what you are interested in, but the analyzed problems can be used as a reference for most people, and this snow tree will provide some functional services To solve such problems allows you to better express yourself, so that you can execute your interests more smoothly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My major in university is related to semiconductors and belongs to the field of electronic technology, so I later realized quadcopter (unmanned aerial vehicle). At that time, I wanted to make one myself (there were already many open source technologies at that time), and this is indeed a pure interest that can support me to work hard. In addition to interest in quadcopters, there is also a lot of improvement in professional knowledge related to semiconductors, chips, computers, algorithms, communications, and physics and mathematics. Due to various reasons, I finally failed to make a homemade quadcopter, although I read a lot of documents. It’s a lot of fun (and touches on physics, computers, math, materials chemistry, etc.).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As mentioned above, I did not complete the self-made quadcopter in the end. The reasons include but are not limited to the following points:</p>

<details>
<summary>1. Knowledge reserve skill issue 2. Resource issue 3 Energy issue 4 Communication issue &amp; team issue</summary>

<p><strong>Knowledge reserve skills problem</strong>,</p>
<p>Semiconductors, chips, computers: The control center of the quadcopter completes the flight, control, take-off and landing, and controls the flight speed. The core hardware flight control chip is required. It completes the program execution and instruction execution written by the programmer, and a large number of calculations , to receive the radio wave signal sent by the remote control. It also involves physics, mechanics, mathematics, Euler angles to complete the calculation and control of flight and flight body attitude, PCB packaging issues, and motor algorithms to complete the control of motor rotation speed and current. Although there are documents, it also took me a lot of time to consult and absorb and understand. </p>

<p><strong>Resource Issues</strong> ,</p>
<p><strong>Required on hardware</strong>: brain - flight control chip limbs - brushless motor propeller heart - lithium battery skeleton - remote control of aircraft shelf <strong>Required on software</strong>: software for writing programs tool. These are great resources. </p>

<p><strong>Energy problems</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned above, there is a lot of knowledge reserves, it is difficult for one person to learn multiple professional knowledge, it may be more reasonable to have one major in physics, one major in computer science and one major in mathematics</p>

<p><strong>Communication Issues &amp; Team Issues</strong> </p>
<p>In fact, it is difficult to complete the quadcopter after solving the problems 1 and 2 above. The energy problem needs to be solved by the team. The energy problem has been solved, but the communication needs to be pulled out separately, because a multi-person team needs to execute things in an orderly manner, with a clear process and a clear division of labor, which requires communication management. </p>

</details>

<p class="note info">The above example just means that complex things cannot be bypassed in terms of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1. knowledge reserve skill issue</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2. resource issue</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3 energy issue</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4 communication issue &amp; team issue</code>,
And people with the same interest can solve these problems through effective <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">communication</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">coordination</code>. The Xueshu platform provides auxiliary services in terms of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">communication</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">coordination</code>, so that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">communication</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">coordination</code> go smoothly.</p>

<h3 id="living-environment">living environment</h3>

<p class="note">There is a difference between humans and monkeys in the mountains. It is obvious that humans have left behind <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">human geography</code>, talked about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">civilization</code>, and talked about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">progress</code>.</p>

<p class="note warning">I hope it is not understood as discrimination against monkeys. It refers to the obvious difference that humans can feel compared with monkeys, and it leads to the topic that the environment has a great impact on people. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Maybe they have their own civilization</code></p>

<blockquote class="note info">
  <p>The predecessors plant trees and the descendants enjoy the shade. The living environment is like calculus. Newton said <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."</code>. I like this sentence very much. He understands that he has learned a lot from his predecessors, and with the help of his teachers and friends, he has successfully achieved success in various fields. , of course he also gives back to society (eg his research paper).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Appearance: Some people were hit by a car while running a red light, some people couldn’t afford to go to school, some people were smashed by a huge concrete bridge while driving (the car was directly smashed), and recently I heard that some people went swimming in Sanya and drowned. People are also full of happiness, and it is wonderful that people are different. Listing the bad ones here is just to say that hopefully some things can improve progress.</p>

<p class="note warning">After airplanes were built in the early 20th century, not all people in the world knew how to fly airplanes. It was the people who built airplanes who first learned how to arrange them and then taught the first wave of people to drive them. After the first wave of people learned it, they gradually became familiar with it. Only the experience of a master can teach others to fly a plane; many things are done step by step, and the more complicated things are, the more so. Running a red light is not an individual, it is universal, it is not an individual issue, it is a matter of time. (It took others many years to make an airplane. If you have to make it in a month and test it, it will only blow up.) This is an analogy, which means that many areas of life need to be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">step by step</code>, otherwise it may <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">explode Machine</code>.</p>

<p>I think that running a red light is a traffic <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">explosion machine</code>, being smashed by cement is a construction <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">explosion machine</code>, and not being able to afford school in a deep mountain is not a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">explosion machine</code>. It is a natural phenomenon. Life is very different, and productivity is not the same.</p>

<h4 id="draw-a-picture">draw a picture</h4>

<p class="note">You can draw a picture with your friends, you can discuss what you want to draw, what if you have different ideas and both stick to your own ideas? Use the canvas alone to paint what you want to paint, and don’t affect your friend’s mood of painting. In this way, I think you should all be in a good mood, and you can all paint what you want to paint. Even after painting two paintings, you can compare and discuss them, without embarrassment at all.</p>

<h4 id="step-by-step">step by step</h4>

<p class="note info">Some of the problems in the living environment mentioned above are just real problems (some problems exist in the world, not just in China), but I don’t want to describe too much; it just means that Xueshu platform hopes to provide its own services, and it is in the strict professional field. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Step-by-step</code> process helps, so that there are fewer problems, and things are done better and with higher quality.</p>

<p>There are fewer traffic accidents by running red lights, and the quality of education is better. Xueshu platform does not directly do these things; Xueshu uses services such as communication, learning and communication to improve users and be better themselves (reasons), and then they are in the field of transportation and education. With better performance (results).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>This is very abstract (when other environment variables remain unchanged), but it is certain, if the user wants to do better.
For example, user A is a member of the traffic bureau, or a driver, or a person who runs a red light, any of the three parties,
The platform hopes to be an external factor that can improve users themselves, so that A can do better,
Any one of the three factors (traffic management, driver, and hit party) involved in the accident of running a red light can do better,
In this way, when a red light accident occurs, it can be handled better (traffic rules, emergency braking when driving, and pedestrian safety awareness).
</code></pre></div></div>

<p class="note warning">The platform is mainly engaged in communication and assistance services based on information protocols and interests. The background mentioned above actually involves many aspects. It just shows that many things can be done by others, and many things can be optimized and done better.</p>

<h2 id="rigorous-in-the-professional-field">Rigorous in the professional field</h2>

<blockquote class="note">
  <p>Professional, specific <strong>field content</strong> is produced by users in the field, and <strong>belongs to users</strong>, not the platform. The platform is a circulation channel to provide communication, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Xueshu platform mainly provides <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">information protocol services</code> such as information exchange, communication and cooperation in professional fields and specific fields. The professional content in the field should be published by professional users themselves, and more will be in the academic field. Users in communication can be Casual, but domain-relevant (user-published) professional content must be rigorous;</p>

<h2 id="make-the-question">Make the question:</h2>

<p>There are a lot of things, involving a lot of professional knowledge, and a team is needed to complete it, and all things cannot be done by individuals. In addition, my physical fitness is not very good. Recently, sometimes I even want to sleep during the day (it’s not that I deliberately want to sleep, my brain is very sleepy, I don’t know if my body is going downhill)</p>

<p>Google is a big platform that provides various services. Obviously, bilibili is the best Internet product I can come into contact with, and bilibili is also a good platform for publishing various works, but there are still differences between them; perhaps many people are not confused by this, because the environment is very complicated now ;</p>
